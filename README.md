- 👋 Hi, I’m Andy and I am from the UK
- 👀 I’m interested in... learning about the various uses of coding, I have used GitHub before for mods on games or for repositories for things like Kodi in the past.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Cyber Security with The Open University so I have started to learn Python as that is the language used throughtout the course.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me learn, I intend to eventually work with someone or a business to earn an income using the skills
- I learn throughout my degree 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
